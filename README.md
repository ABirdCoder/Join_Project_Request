# Hey there
None of our projects will be directly committed to as we will be using Pull Requests **only** to ensure security across the board before changes are applied, Same here.

## Applying
You can apply by creating a file in the format [`#members/example.json`](members/example.json) within the [`#members`](members) folder. You must create a pull request.
