# Hey there
None of our projects will be directly committed to as we will be using Pull Requests **only** to ensure security across the board before changes are applied, Same here.

## Applying
You can apply by creating a file in the format [`#members/example.json`](members/example.json) within the [`#members`](members). You must create a pull request.
You will need to wait a few days but not many applications are expected due to being quite unknown. Overall, your file should be filled out like the following

```json
{
  "username": "ExampleUsername",
  "projects": ["Currently Running Project Names"],
  "about": {
    "links": ["Link to your previous work", "ETC"],
    "roles": ["Graphics Artist", "Writer", "ETC"],
    "values": "Short answer of what values you would add"
  }
  "timezone": "GMT +00:00"
}
```
